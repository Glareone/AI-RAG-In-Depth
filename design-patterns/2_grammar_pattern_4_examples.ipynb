    "* Guaranteed Format Compliance for Real Business Use Cases\n",
    "* Generate proper queries\n",
    "* Recognize and Extract Named Entities\n",
    "* Generate Pipe-separated data, for instance, for .Markdown tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Grammar Pattern with 4 practical examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insurance Forms** - Complex nested JSON extraction\n",
    "2. **SQL Query Generation** - Generate valid SQL against real database\n",
    "3. **Pipe-Separated Data** - Extract structured data with strict format\n",
    "4. **Arithmetic Expressions** - Educational math software\n",

Extract all relevant information from the claim form.\n    \n    ## Insurance Form Structure:\n    \n    The insurance claim form typically contains the following sections:\n    \n    ### 1. HEADER SECTION\n    - Claim ID/Reference number (e.g., \"CLM-2026-00472\")\n    - Filing date (when the claim was submitted)\n    \n    ### 2. CLAIMANT INFORMATION SECTION\n    - Full legal name of the person filing the claim\n    - Policy number (format: POL-XXXXXX-XX)\n    - Contact phone number (format: (XXX) XXX-XXXX)\n    - Email address (optional)\n    \n    ### 3. INCIDENT DETAILS SECTION\n    - Date of accident/incident (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n    - Location: full address including street, city, state, and zip code\n    - Weather conditions at time of incident (optional)\n    - Police report information (whether filed, report number if available)\n    - Detailed narrative description of what happened\n    \n    ### 4. VEHICLES INVOLVED (for auto claims)\n    Each vehicle section includes:\n    - Year, Make, Model (e.g., \"2023 Toyota Camry\")\n    - License plate number\n    - VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) - optional\n    - For other vehicles: driver name, driver's policy number, contact info\n    \n    ### 5. DAMAGES SECTION\n    List of damaged components for each vehicle:\n    - Component name (e.g., \"front bumper\", \"passenger door\", \"windshield\")\n    - Detailed description of the damage\n    - Estimated repair cost in USD (numeric value)\n    \n    ### 6. INJURIES SECTION (if applicable)\n    For each injured person:\n    - Person's name\n    - Type of injury (none, minor, serious, critical)\n    - Description of injuries\n    - Medical facility where treated (hospital/clinic name) - optional\n    \n    ### 7. ASSESSMENT SECTION\n    - Severity classification (minor, moderate, severe, total_loss)\n    - Total estimated damages (sum of all repair costs)\n    - Priority level (low, medium, high, urgent) - often based on injuries and severity\n    \n    ## Extraction Rules:\n    \n    1. **Be thorough**: Extract ALL vehicles mentioned, even if it's the other driver's vehicle\n    2. **Accuracy**: Use exact values from the form - don't approximate or round numbers\n    3. **Dates**: Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format\n    4. **Costs**: Extract numeric values only, convert to float (remove $, commas)\n    5. **Enums**: Map text to correct enum values:\n       - Claim type: auto, health, home, life\n       - Severity: minor, moderate, severe, total_loss\n       - Injury type: none, minor, serious, critical\n    6. **Missing data**: Use appropriate defaults:\n       - Optional fields can be null\n       - Use empty lists [] for injuries if none reported\n    7. **Priority**: Infer from context:\n       - urgent: life-threatening injuries or total loss\n       - high: any injuries or severe damage\n       - medium: moderate damage, no injuries\n       - low: minor damage only\n    \n    ## Common Patterns to Watch For:\n    \n    - \"MY VEHICLE\" vs \"OTHER VEHICLE\" sections - both should be included\n    - Damage estimates may be listed per item or as subtotals\n    - Police report: \"Yes\" means filed=true, extract the report number\n    - Multiple people may be injured in a single incident\n    - The claimant's vehicle should be listed first in vehicles_involved\n    \n    Extract with precision and completeness.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    response = client.beta.chat.completions.parse(\n        model=MODEL,\n        messages=[\n            {\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": system_prompt},\n            {\"role\": \"user\", \"content\": form_text}\n        ],\n        response_format=InsuranceClaim,\n        temperature=0\n    )\n    \n    return response.choices[0].message.parsed\n\nprint(\"Extracting insurance claim with enhanced system prompt...\")\nprint(\"=\" * 80)\n\nclaim = extract_insurance_claim(insurance_form_text)\n\nprint(\"\\n✅ SUCCESSFULLY EXTRACTED!\\n\")\nprint(f\"Claim ID: {claim.claim_id}\")\nprint(f\"Type: {claim.claim_type.value}\")\nprint(f\"Priority: {claim.priority}\")\nprint(f\"\\nClaimant: {claim.claimant.full_name}\")\nprint(f\"Policy: {claim.claimant.policy_number}\")\nprint(f\"\\nIncident Date: {claim.incident.incident_date}\")\nprint(f\"Location: {claim.incident.incident_location.street}, {claim.incident.incident_location.city}\")\nprint(f\"Severity: {claim.incident.severity.value}\")\nprint(f\"Police Report: {'Yes' if claim.incident.police_report_filed else 'No'}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nVehicles Involved: {len(claim.incident.vehicles_involved)}\")\nfor i, vehicle in enumerate(claim.incident.vehicles_involved, 1):\n    print(f\"  {i}. {vehicle.year} {vehicle.make} {vehicle.model} ({vehicle.license_plate})\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nDamages: {len(claim.incident.damages)}\")\nfor i, damage in enumerate(claim.incident.damages, 1):\n    print(f\"  {i}. {damage.component}: ${damage.estimated_cost:,.2f}\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nInjuries: {len(claim.incident.injuries)}\")\nfor i, injury in enumerate(claim.incident.injuries, 1):\n    print(f\"  {i}. {injury.person_name}: {injury.injury_type.value} - {injury.description[:50]}...\")\n\nprint(f\"\\nTotal Estimated Cost: ${claim.total_estimated_cost:,.2f}\")\n\nprint(\"\\n\" + \"=\" * 80)\nprint(\"\\n🎯 ENHANCED SYSTEM PROMPT BENEFITS:\")\nprint(\"  ✅ Explains insurance form structure in detail\")\nprint(\"  ✅ Provides clear extraction rules\")\nprint(\"  ✅ Guides on handling edge cases (MY VEHICLE vs OTHER VEHICLE)\")\nprint(\"  ✅ Specifies date and number formatting\")\nprint(\"  ✅ Maps common phrases to enum values\")\nprint(\"  ✅ Improves accuracy with context-specific instructions\")",

    "# Summary: Grammar Pattern Across 4 Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We Demonstrated\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Insurance Forms (Complex Nested JSON)\n",
    "**Business Value:**\n",
    "- Process thousands of claims without parsing errors\n",
    "- Guaranteed valid structure for downstream systems\n",
    "- No manual validation needed\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grammar Guarantees:**\n",
    "- All required fields present\n",
    "- Enums constrained (claim types, severity levels)\n",
    "- Nested structures valid\n",
    "- Lists properly formatted\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. SQL Query Generation\n",
    "**Business Value:**\n",
    "- Natural language to SQL without syntax errors\n",
    "- Queries executable without manual fixing\n",
    "- Consistent format (query + explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grammar Guarantees:**\n",
    "- Valid SQL structure\n",
    "- Proper column and table references\n",
    "- Executable queries\n",
    "- No database errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Pipe-Separated Data\n",
    "**Business Value:**\n",
    "- Export data for legacy systems\n",
    "- Guaranteed format compliance\n",
    "- Direct import without preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grammar Guarantees:**\n",
    "- Exactly 3 pipes per line\n",
    "- Correct field count\n",
    "- NULL for missing data\n",
    "- Numeric prices\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Math Expressions\n",
    "**Business Value:**\n",
    "- Educational software shows process, not answers\n",
    "- Students learn problem-solving\n",
    "- Consistent teaching format\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grammar Guarantees:**\n",
    "- Pure math expressions (no answers)\n",
    "- Descriptive variable names\n",
    "- Variables with values\n",
    "- Never reveals final answer\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Grammar Pattern:\n",
    "1. ✅ Need guaranteed output format\n",
    "2. ✅ Downstream systems require specific structure\n",
    "3. ✅ Parsing errors are costly\n",
    "4. ✅ Format validation is critical\n",
    "5. ✅ Want type safety and IDE support\n",
    "\n",
    "### Three Approaches:\n",
    "1. **Pydantic Schema** (Used in Examples 1, 3, 4)\n",
    "   - Most user-friendly\n",
    "   - Perfect for JSON and structured data\n",
    "   - Works with API models\n",
    "   - Server-side (fast)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **JSON Mode** (Quick prototyping)\n",
    "   - Simplest approach\n",
    "   - Just guarantees valid JSON\n",
    "   - No field constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **BNF Grammar** (Maximum control)\n",
    "   - Custom formats (SQL, CSV, math)\n",
    "   - Complex validation rules\n",
    "   - Self-hosted models\n",
    "   - Client-side\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Impact:\n",
    "- ✅ Zero parsing errors\n",
    "- ✅ Predictable costs (no regeneration)\n",
    "- ✅ Type-safe code\n",
    "- ✅ No manual validation\n",
    "- ✅ Downstream systems never crash\n",
    "- ✅ 100% format compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Choose the right approach for your use case\n",
    "2. Define your schema/grammar\n",
    "3. Test with sample data\n",
    "4. Deploy with confidence (no parsing errors!)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remember:** Grammar Pattern = Logits Masking done by the framework. It's Pattern #1 automated for format rules!"
