    "1) compare Structured Output and True Grammar Pattern.\n",

    "* Guaranteed Format and Rule Compliance\n",
    "* Generate Proper SQL Query\n",
    "* Fix grammar in your input sentence (generating the correct one on output)\n",
    "* Understand the underlying rules (math, natural language, query language, etc)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the Grammar Pattern with 4 practical examples and touches the model from different angles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Insurance Forms** - Complex nested JSON extraction\n",
    "2. **SQL Query Generation** - Generate valid SQL against real database using Grammar pattern and `outlines`\n",
    "3. **Pipe-Separated Data** - Extract structured data with strict format\n",
    "4. **English** - fix the grammar in your sentence\n",
    "\n",

    "    \n",
    "    The insurance claim form typically contains the following sections:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 1. HEADER SECTION\n",
    "    - Claim ID/Reference number (e.g., \"CLM-2026-00472\")\n",
    "    - Filing date (when the claim was submitted)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 2. CLAIMANT INFORMATION SECTION\n",
    "    - Full legal name of the person filing the claim\n",
    "    - Policy number (format: POL-XXXXXX-XX)\n",
    "    - Contact phone number (format: (XXX) XXX-XXXX)\n",
    "    - Email address (optional)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 3. INCIDENT DETAILS SECTION\n",
    "    - Date of accident/incident (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n",
    "    - Location: full address including street, city, state, and zip code\n",
    "    - Weather conditions at time of incident (optional)\n",
    "    - Police report information (whether filed, report number if available)\n",
    "    - Detailed narrative description of what happened\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 4. VEHICLES INVOLVED (for auto claims)\n",
    "    Each vehicle section includes:\n",
    "    - Year, Make, Model (e.g., \"2023 Toyota Camry\")\n",
    "    - License plate number\n",
    "    - VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) - optional\n",
    "    - For other vehicles: driver name, driver's policy number, contact info\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 5. DAMAGES SECTION\n",
    "    List of damaged components for each vehicle:\n",
    "    - Component name (e.g., \"front bumper\", \"passenger door\", \"windshield\")\n",
    "    - Detailed description of the damage\n",
    "    - Estimated repair cost in USD (numeric value)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 6. INJURIES SECTION (if applicable)\n",
    "    For each injured person:\n",
    "    - Person's name\n",
    "    - Type of injury (none, minor, serious, critical)\n",
    "    - Description of injuries\n",
    "    - Medical facility where treated (hospital/clinic name) - optional\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 7. ASSESSMENT SECTION\n",
    "    - Severity classification (minor, moderate, severe, total_loss)\n",
    "    - Total estimated damages (sum of all repair costs)\n",
    "    - Priority level (low, medium, high, urgent) - often based on injuries and severity\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Extraction Rules:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Be thorough**: Extract ALL vehicles mentioned, even if it's the other driver's vehicle\n",
    "    2. **Accuracy**: Use exact values from the form - don't approximate or round numbers\n",
    "    3. **Dates**: Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format\n",
    "    4. **Costs**: Extract numeric values only, convert to float (remove $, commas)\n",
    "    5. **Enums**: Map text to correct enum values:\n",
    "       - Claim type: auto, health, home, life\n",
    "       - Severity: minor, moderate, severe, total_loss\n",
    "       - Injury type: none, minor, serious, critical\n",
    "    6. **Missing data**: Use appropriate defaults:\n",
    "       - Optional fields can be null\n",
    "       - Use empty lists [] for injuries if none reported\n",
    "    7. **Priority**: Infer from context:\n",
    "       - urgent: life-threatening injuries or total loss\n",
    "       - high: any injuries or severe damage\n",
    "       - medium: moderate damage, no injuries\n",
    "       - low: minor damage only\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Common Patterns to Watch For:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - \"MY VEHICLE\" vs \"OTHER VEHICLE\" sections - both should be included\n",
    "    - Damage estimates may be listed per item or as subtotals\n",
    "    - Police report: \"Yes\" means filed=true, extract the report number\n",
    "    - Multiple people may be injured in a single incident\n",
    "    - The claimant's vehicle should be listed first in vehicles_involved\n",
