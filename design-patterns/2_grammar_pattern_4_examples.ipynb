Grammar: 5 Examples (Including Deep Dive)\n\n## Educational Arc: From Practice to Understanding\n\nThis notebook demonstrates the Grammar Pattern with **5 practical examples** that progress from high-level usage to foundational understanding:\n\n1. **Insurance Forms** - Complex nested JSON extraction (Pydantic schemas)\n2. **SQL Query Generation** - Generate safe SQL with BNF Grammar Pattern (outlines + llama-cpp)\n3. **Pipe-Separated Data** - Extract structured data with strict format (Pydantic)\n4. **English Grammar Correction** - Fix grammar with output constraints (outlines + regex)\n5. **🎓 Math Expression Generation** - **Deep dive into direct logits processing**\n\n### 📚 Abstraction Levels\n\n| Level | Approach | Examples | What You See |\n|-------|----------|----------|--------------|\n| **High** | Pydantic + API | 1, 3 | Define schema, get structured output |\n| **Medium** | outlines/llama-cpp | 2, 4 | Define grammar/regex, library handles rest |\n| **Low** | Direct logits | **5** | **See HOW it works under the hood** |\n\n**💡 Key Insight:** Example 5 reveals the **foundational mechanism** that `outlines` and `llama-cpp` use internally. Understanding this makes you appreciate why grammar constraints provide 100% guarantees!\n\n---\n\n## Notebook ideas\n\n1) compare Structured Output and True Grammar Pattern.\n2) demonstrate how to use True Grammar Pattern using llama-cpp and outlines.\n3) 🎓 **Deep Dive**: Understand how it works internally with direct logits processing (Example 5)\n\n## Cases + Ideas\n* Guaranteed Format and Rule Compliance\n* Generate Proper SQL Query\n* Fix grammar in your input sentence (generating the correct one on output)\n* Understand the underlying rules (math, natural language, query language, etc)\n\n**Key Learning:** Grammar Pattern provides 100% guarantee of valid output format through token-level logits masking.\n\n## Approach Comparison. Structured output vs Grammar Pattern\n\n|  Feature | Grammar Pattern         | Structured Outputs                |\n|----------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|\n|          | (outlines)              | (Azure OpenAI)                    |\n| Implementation           | Self-hosted model       | Azure OpenAI API                  |\n| Constraint Type          | Token-level grammar     | Schema + parsing                  |\n| Safety Guarantee         | ✅ HARD (impossible)     | ⚠️  SOFT (almost impossible, 99%) |\n| Grammar Support          | ✅ BNF, regex, FSM       | ❌ Not supported                   |\n| Dangerous SQL Blocking   | ✅ Physically blocked    | ⚠️  Relies on prompt              |\n| Output Structure         | ⚠️  Text (grammar)      | ✅ Pydantic objects                |\n| Setup Complexity         | Medium (install)        | Low (just API)                    |\n| Runtime Performance      | Local (fast)            | API call (latency)                |\n| Cost                     | Hardware only           | Per-token pricing                 |\n| Model Control            | ✅ Full control          | ❌ Server-side only                |"

    "    You are an expert insurance claim processing system. Extract all relevant information from the claim form.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Insurance Form Structure:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The insurance claim form typically contains the following sections:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 1. HEADER SECTION\n",
    "    - Claim ID/Reference number (e.g., \"CLM-2026-00472\")\n",
    "    - Filing date (when the claim was submitted)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 2. CLAIMANT INFORMATION SECTION\n",
    "    - Full legal name of the person filing the claim\n",
    "    - Policy number (format: POL-XXXXXX-XX)\n",
    "    - Contact phone number (format: (XXX) XXX-XXXX)\n",
    "    - Email address (optional)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 3. INCIDENT DETAILS SECTION\n",
    "    - Date of accident/incident (YYYY-MM-DD format)\n",
    "    - Location: full address including street, city, state, and zip code\n",
    "    - Weather conditions at time of incident (optional)\n",
    "    - Police report information (whether filed, report number if available)\n",
    "    - Detailed narrative description of what happened\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 4. VEHICLES INVOLVED (for auto claims)\n",
    "    Each vehicle section includes:\n",
    "    - Year, Make, Model (e.g., \"2023 Toyota Camry\")\n",
    "    - License plate number\n",
    "    - VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) - optional\n",
    "    - For other vehicles: driver name, driver's policy number, contact info\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 5. DAMAGES SECTION\n",
    "    List of damaged components for each vehicle:\n",
    "    - Component name (e.g., \"front bumper\", \"passenger door\", \"windshield\")\n",
    "    - Detailed description of the damage\n",
    "    - Estimated repair cost in USD (numeric value)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 6. INJURIES SECTION (if applicable)\n",
    "    For each injured person:\n",
    "    - Person's name\n",
    "    - Type of injury (none, minor, serious, critical)\n",
    "    - Description of injuries\n",
    "    - Medical facility where treated (hospital/clinic name) - optional\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ### 7. ASSESSMENT SECTION\n",
    "    - Severity classification (minor, moderate, severe, total_loss)\n",
    "    - Total estimated damages (sum of all repair costs)\n",
    "    - Priority level (low, medium, high, urgent) - often based on injuries and severity\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Extraction Rules:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1. **Be thorough**: Extract ALL vehicles mentioned, even if it's the other driver's vehicle\n",
    "    2. **Accuracy**: Use exact values from the form - don't approximate or round numbers\n",
    "    3. **Dates**: Convert all dates to YYYY-MM-DD format\n",
    "    4. **Costs**: Extract numeric values only, convert to float (remove $, commas)\n",
    "    5. **Enums**: Map text to correct enum values:\n",
    "       - Claim type: auto, health, home, life\n",
    "       - Severity: minor, moderate, severe, total_loss\n",
    "       - Injury type: none, minor, serious, critical\n",
    "    6. **Missing data**: Use appropriate defaults:\n",
    "       - Optional fields can be null\n",
    "       - Use empty lists [] for injuries if none reported\n",
    "    7. **Priority**: Infer from context:\n",
    "       - urgent: life-threatening injuries or total loss\n",
    "       - high: any injuries or severe damage\n",
    "       - medium: moderate damage, no injuries\n",
    "       - low: minor damage only\n",
    "    \n",
    "    ## Common Patterns to Watch For:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - \"MY VEHICLE\" vs \"OTHER VEHICLE\" sections - both should be included\n",
    "    - Damage estimates may be listed per item or as subtotals\n",
    "    - Police report: \"Yes\" means filed=true, extract the report number\n",
    "    - Multiple people may be injured in a single incident\n",
    "    - The claimant's vehicle should be listed first in vehicles_involved\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Extract with precision and completeness.\n",

    "## Deep Dive: Understanding How Grammar Constraints Work Internally\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Examples 2 and 4**, we used the `outlines` library which provides a high-level abstraction. In the **llama-cpp alternative**, we showed another library approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "**But how do they actually work under the hood?**\n",

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Math tutoring applications need to:\n",
    "- Extract mathematical expressions from word problems\n",
    "- Ensure output is ONLY valid mathematical syntax (no explanations)\n",
    "- Block natural language responses\n",
    "- Generate symbolic expressions that can be evaluated programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**Challenge**: LLMs naturally want to explain their reasoning instead of just providing expressions.\n",

    "**Solution**: Use grammar constraints to physically block all tokens except valid math expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What We'll Demonstrate\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike previous examples, we'll:\n",
    "- Use **direct logits manipulation** with `GrammarConstrainedLogitsProcessor`\n",
    "- See the **low-level mechanism** that libraries abstract away\n",
    "- Understand **how grammar constraints work at the token level**\n",
