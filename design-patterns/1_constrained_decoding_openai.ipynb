    "### What `Azure OpenAI` Structured Outputs does:\n",
    "1. ✅ Guarantees valid JSON structure\n",
    "2. ✅ Enforces enum values (sentiment, category)\n",
    "3. ✅ Enforces type constraints (rating must be int 1-5)\n",
    "4. ✅ Ensures required fields are present\n",
    "5. ✅ No parsing errors, ever\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works with `Azure OpenAI`:\n",
    "- Uses the `response_format` parameter with Pydantic models\n",
    "- The model's output is constrained to match the schema\n",
    "- Built directly into Azure OpenAI API (no external libraries needed)\n",
    "- Leverages the `.beta.chat.completions.parse()` method\n",

    "1. ✅ The same but using outlines library and slightly different code\n",
